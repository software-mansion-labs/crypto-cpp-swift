# crypto-cpp-swift

Bash script to compile the crypto-cpp library for ios targets and pack them as xcframework.

Currently it supports:
- arm64 ios
- arm64 iossimulator

But will soon support x86_64 simulator as well.

To compile for specific target, change ios_version variable in build.sh script.

Remember to pull submodules when cloning the repo.
